This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `camera.current` property before the component has fully mounted.  This often happens if you try to use the camera within the component's `constructor` or before the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array has completed its first execution.  The camera might not be ready and therefore `camera.current` is `null` leading to a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'current')`.
