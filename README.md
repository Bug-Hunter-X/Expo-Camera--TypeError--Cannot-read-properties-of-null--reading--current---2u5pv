# Expo Camera TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'current')

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API and provides a solution. The error, `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'current')`, arises from attempting to access the `camera.current` property before the component has mounted and the camera is ready.

## Problem

The primary cause is accessing the `camera.current` property too early in the component's lifecycle.  Common scenarios include:

* Attempting to use the camera in the `constructor`.
* Accessing it in a `useEffect` hook without proper dependency management.

This leads to `camera.current` being null, resulting in the error.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that `camera.current` is accessed only *after* the component has mounted and the camera is ready. This is typically achieved using the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array or by checking for `camera.current` before access.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
